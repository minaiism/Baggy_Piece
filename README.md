# BaggyPiece Application

BaggyPiece (Baggy is named for the loose-fitting clothes - in particular, the bell-bottomed jeans and oversized sweatshirts - worn by the bands and the fans, in a throwback to the styles worn by the hippies and the '70's rock crowd. This distinct style of clothing, the mix of '60's psychedelia with '70's cool, mirrored the bands' fusion of '60's music with '70's funk, all in an acid house context. Baggy became defined as a style in which funk/hip hop bass and drum rhythms were combined with jangly indie guitars, Piece as a musical composition) is a RESTFUL web application created by using Bootstrap as a frontend framework.
